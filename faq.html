            <h2>Is there a Gymboree Play &amp; Music location near me?</h2>
            <p>With over 650 locations in over 33 countries, there should be a Gymboree Play &amp; Music location near you. For U.S. and Canadian locations, please enter your zip in the Find a Location field at the top of this page. View <a href="template-locations-international.html">international locations</a>.</p>
            <h2>How can I preview a free class?</h2>
            <p>You can sign up to preview a free class in several ways. If you click on the Free Class Pass promotion on this website, you will be directed to a page that you can print out and take to the location nearest you. Or, you can start by finding the location that is most convenient for you through the Find a Location link at the top of this page. Then choose the type of class at the appropriate age level on the calendar that appears and sign up for a Free Class online. Additionally, you can call the Gymboree Play &amp; Music location most convenient for you and arrange for your Free Class preview.</p>
            <h2>How much do classes cost?</h2>
            <p>Gymboree Play and Music locations are independently owned and operated. Therefore, schedules and pricing guidelines vary between locations. For pricing information at your location, please <a href="template-location.html">find the location</a> nearest you and <a href="template-classes.html">view the calendar</a>. Or, you may call the <a href="template-location.html">location</a> directly. There is also a New Member (one-time only) fee and a few classes have additional fees for materials.</p>
            <h2>Why should I enroll my child in a Gymboree Play &amp;   Music program?</h2>
            <p>With over 30 years of experience, Gymboree's programs are designed by child-development experts to help provide children ages 0-5 with the cognitive, physical and social skills they need. Because children learn by playing, our classes feature age-appropriate activities that encourage children to problem-solve and think creatively. And because adults attend the classes too, you'll be an integral part of your child's learning and enjoyment. To read more, <a href="template-why-gymboree.html">click here</a>.</p>
            <h2>How do I enroll my child in a class?</h2>
            <p>To enroll in a Gymboree Play &amp; Music class, start by <a href="template-location.html">finding the location</a> most convenient for you. Then, determine the appropriate class program and level for your child and locate the class on the calendar for that location. Once you have found the class you are interested in, select "Enroll Now". The system will lead you through the enrollment process. Not all locations offer the ability to enroll online. In this situation, please call the location for information about enrolling.</p>
            <p>If you need assistance finding a location or contacting a location, please call our Customer Service team members at <a href="tel:1-877-449-6932" class="phone small">1-877-4-GYMWEB</a> (1-877-449-6932), Monday through Friday, 6am to 9pm, Saturday, 7am to 3pm, or Sunday 8am to 4pm, PT.</p>
            <p>Customers that are currently enrolled in Gymboree Play &amp; Music should contact their local site before creating an online account.

            <h2>Can I enroll online for classes at more than one location?</h2>
            <p>Because Gymboree Play &amp; Music centers are franchise-owned, multiple location enrollments cannot be processed in the same transaction. However, you can enroll in classes in separate transactions. Please call the locations to inquire about enrolling at multiple locations.</p>
            <h2>Can I bring more than one sibling to a Gymboree Play &amp;   Music class?</h2>
            <p>Our classes are designed to allow parents to interact and play with their child one-on-one in order to maximize the child's success. If you have more than one child, there are new ways for you and your family to experience a variety of classes at Gymboree. We welcome up to four siblings to attend the same class in the appropriate age levels, and we also offer Family Classes in Gymboree Play &amp; Learn, Art and Music. Check your local site's calendar or call your local site to find out when these classes are offered.</p>
