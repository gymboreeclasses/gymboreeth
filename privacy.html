            <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Gymboree Corporation's brands, including Gymboree, Gymboree Play &amp; Music, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Janie and Jack Outlet and Crazy 8 (collectively, "Gymboree" or "we," "us" or "our"), values you as a customer and respects your privacy. We collect certain information from you that allows us to customize and enhance your shopping experience and to communicate with you about products, services, sweepstakes, contests, and promotions. Please carefully review this policy to learn about how we collect, use, protect, and share any personal information you provide us and your choices for managing your personal information. This policy is subject to our website Terms of Use.</p>
            <h2>What This Policy Covers</h2>
            <p>This policy describes the personal information and other information we collect from you and why; how we use this information; when we share this information with third parties; the choices you can make about how your personal information is collected, used, or shared; and the data security, accuracy, and access measures we have adopted to protect your information under our control from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
            <p>This policy applies solely to information collected by us, including, at our stores and on or through websites owned and operated by Gymboree or its subsidiaries and related entities (such websites shall be collectively referred to as our "Sites"). This policy does not apply to the practices of people that Gymboree does not employ or companies that Gymboree does not own or operate (including those Gymboree Play &amp; Music Centers that are independently owned and operated by franchisees). By providing your personal information to Gymboree, you agree that Gymboree may process your personal information in accordance with this policy.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other websites hosted by third parties. Gymboree does not control and is not responsible for the content or privacy practices and policies of such third party websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave one of our Sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every third party website, especially if such websites collect personal information from you.</p>
            <h2>Your Privacy Rights: Opting Out Of Marketing And Transfers;    Accessing, Updating And Deleting Information</h2>
            <p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

            <p>You have the right to request a copy of the information which we hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee). In addition, if you would like to access, verify, correct, update, or delete your e-mail address, mailing address, or other personal information with us please contact us the same way. Please note that it may take up to two weeks for your request to become effective. Thereafter, when you make purchases, we may still send you an e-mail confirmation and may need to contact you by phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have questions regarding your order.</p>
            <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number (including your cell phone number), credit card numbers, gender, occupation, personal interests, and your child's date of birth, only if you choose to share such information with us. Gymboree collects personal information from you when you sign in on one of our Sites, sign up (whether online or in-store) for membership to our Gymboree Rewards program, use a membership or rewards program number, register for online shopping, place an order, return products that have been purchased, enroll your child in a Play &amp; Music class, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion, or survey, or request other services that require information, registration, or subscription. We may also keep a record of your product interests and purchases online and in our stores as this may have an impact upon the content of our communications with you. Whether or not you provide any of your personal information is your own choice. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products or access certain services, offers, and content on our Sites, from our catalogs (if we so choose to distribute catalogs), or at our locations.</p>
            <p>Like most websites, our Sites automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data.</p>
            <p>We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your web browser) and web beacons (an electronic file placed within a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and web beacons to improve the quality of our Sites, to keep track of your electronic shopping bag and to remember you if you sign in to your account. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of our Sites may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our service providers (as described below) may also use cookies and web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.</p>
            <p>We may combine information you give us online or in our locations and/or we may also combine such information with publicly available information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.</p>
            <h2>When We May Share Information With Others</h2>
            <p>We will not sell, share, or rent personal information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose personal information to third parties, without your permission, except as disclosed in this policy.</p>
            <p>From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. For example, we may contract with service providers to provide certain services including credit card processing, data management, promotional services, Web hosting, Web development, etc. We provide our service providers only with the information (which may include your personal information) needed for them to perform these services. Each service provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
            <p>Where you have given your permission, or where otherwise permitted by applicable laws, in certain instances we may disclose personal information and other information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect Gymboree or our customers or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure.</p>
            <p>We may also share or cross-reference, or cause to be shared or cross-referenced, such information, including your personal information, with unrelated companies you may be interested in so that the companies can directly market their products or services to you; provided, however, you may always opt out of such marketing efforts (as described above).</p>
            <p>We may also use overseas facilities to process, store, or back up electronic information. As a result, you hereby consent to us transferring your personal information to overseas facilities for such purposes.</p>
            <p>We may also share your personal information and other information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Gymboree. In the event that some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we would transfer your information to the buyer or transferee and for due diligence purposes to its professional advisors under an obligation of confidentiality.</p>
            <p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Sites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to our Sites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies or web beacons on our Sites enable you to opt out of this advertising practice. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org. We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us or certain transfers of your information. You can learn about this in the “Your Privacy Rights” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Please note that, from time to time, personal information collected from you may be processed and stored by us or our service providers in jurisdictions in which disclosure may be compelled by governments, law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies of those jurisdictions as required or permitted by the laws and courts of those jurisdictions. Depending on the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, we may not be allowed to provide notice to you of such required disclosure.</p>
            <p>By providing your personal information to us, either online or in-store, you agree that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes outlined above.</p>
            <h2>How We Protect Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Gymboree is concerned about the safety and security of children when they use the Internet. Each of our Sites is intended for a general audience, and children under the age of 13 are not permitted to register with our Sites. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
            <h2>Data Security and Integrity</h2>
            <p>Gymboree takes the security and integrity of your information very seriously. As a result, we do not accept orders by e-mail. We will gladly accept your orders online at gymboree.com or by phone at 1-877-4-GYMWEB (1-877-449-6932). Our Customer Service hours are Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., and Sunday 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (U.S. and Canada Pacific Time).</p>
            <p>Your Gymboree account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Gymboree will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information. Remember to sign out of your Gymboree account and close your browser window when you have completed your shopping to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information.</p>
            <p>In addition, when you submit personal information via one of our Sites, such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted and protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology and stored on servers using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our Sites, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through our Sites, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <p>If at any time you believe the security of your password or account information has been compromised, please notify the Gymboree Customer Service Team at the telephone number above or change your member information online. Should you discover an unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you should immediately notify your card provider in accordance with the terms of your agreement with that company.</p>
            <h2>European Union Residents</h2>
            <p>For European Union and Swiss Residents, if you choose to provide us with your personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.</p>
            <p>Gymboree adheres to the EU-US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Program.</p>
            <p>Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of your information should be directed to Gymboree by e-mailing us at privacy@gymboree.com. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. European Union and Swiss Residents, if your complaints cannot be resolved, we have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the JAMS pursuant to the US-EU Safe Harbor and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.</p>
            <h2>Changes to Policy</h2>
            <p>Gymboree reserves the right to change, modify or amend this policy from time to time. We will post the changes here. Your continued use of our Sites constitutes your agreement to abide by the policy as changed. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse shall be to cease using our Sites.</p>
            <h2>Your Feedback</h2>
